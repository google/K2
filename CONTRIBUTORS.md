# K2 Contributors & Contributing to K2

## Who is involved & acknowledgements
Much of the design of K2 come from the work of to Daniel Bleichenbacher.
Additional design was done by Shawn Willden, Devin Lundberg, Ben Laurie,
and Andrew Sacamano. The next round of design work and implementation was
done by John Maheswaran and Daryl Seah.

Jay Tuley, Damian Gryski, and Evan Jones all provided excellent advice
about how to go in K2, based on their excperience in using KeyCzar.

Thanks also go to the developers, maintainers, and contributors to KeyCzar,
and the Google internal libraries that inspired it: we love what you have
done and hope you will like K2.


## Contributing

You can download the code and experiment with it all you like.  But if you
think you would like to contribute your udpates, you should do two things:

1. Read the HACKING file.
2. Sign a CLA (keep reading this file).

# All contributors to K2 must sign a CLA.

## What is a CLA?

A CLA (Contributor License Agreement) basically says that you own the
rights to any code you contribute, and that you give us permission to
use that code in Closure Compiler. You maintain the copyright on that
code.

## Where do I sign up?

If you own all the rights to your code, you can fill out an individual CLA.

If your employer has any rights to your code, then they also need to fill
out a corporate CLA. If you don't know if your employer has any rights
to your code, you should ask before signing anything.

## CLA Signers

By default, anyone with an @google.com email address already has a CLA
signed for them. Congratulations!

We've also received CLAs from the following people:
