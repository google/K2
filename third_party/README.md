## What goes here
This directory will contain any third party code or libraries that need to be
distirbuted with K2 - if there any any.

## Adding things here
In general, we don't expect to be adding things here - we expect to be asking
developers & deployers to get any third party dependencies themselves, and
K2 will just link to them.  But if we find a situation where that won't work,
this is where such things will go.
