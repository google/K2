## What is K2?
K2 is a cryptographic toolkit that provides an easy, code-reviewable way to do
crypto safely - avoiding many of the subtle problems that come up when you
do crypto yourself.

## Status of K2
K2 is currently in the design and early build phase.

## What should I use instead?
[KeyCzar](http://www.keyczar.org) is great, and we recommend using that until K2
is ready.

## Mailing list
Developers:
[k2-crypto-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/k2-crypto-dev) Google
