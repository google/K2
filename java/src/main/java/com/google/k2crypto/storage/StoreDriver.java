/**
 * Driver interface for a {@link Key} storage location.
 * <p>
 * Drivers are concrete implementations of a {@link Store}. In addition to
 * implementing this interface, the instantiatable driver class must be
 * annotated with {@link StoreDriverInfo} and provide a public constructor
 * with no arguments. When instantiated, {@link #initialize(K2Context)}
 * will be invoked on the driver to provide the context of the current K2
 * session. After a successful initialization, {@link #open(URI)} will be
 * called to actually allocate resources for performing storage operations
 * on the specified storage address. This method may throw {@link
 * IllegalAddressException} if the address is not recognized by the
 * driver. Finally, {@link #close()} will be called to free resources, after
 * the user has performed the storage operations. Note that it is NOT safe to
 * allocate resources before {@link #open(URI)} is called, e.g. during
 * construction or on initialize.
 * <p>
 * Drivers need not be concerned with thread safety, or methods invoked when
 * they are not supported, or methods invoked when {@link #open(URI)} has not
 * been called, or methods invoked when {@link #close()} has been called. The
 * {@link Store} wrapper will manage all access to the driver by ensuring that
 * calls are synchronized, methods are not invoked when inappropriate, etc. 
 * <p>
 * A note about open/close and network-based stores: It is possible for the
 * network connection to drop after the driver is opened. However, the driver
 * must not implicitly close the store in this event. As long as the store is
 * still open, the connection should be reattempted.

   * <p>
   * An open may fail if the address is illegal with respect to the driver
   * implementation; e.g. it contains invalid characters that will not map

   * but points to an unsuitable location; e.g. it contains existing files not
